// TODO: PART 2 - Listen for Custom Event and Display Associates on DOM
// Which Component Needs to Listen for the "showAssociates" event?
// ** New AssociatesModalComponent
// Create ModalComponent that takes in a Criminal object and returns some HTML representation of a criminalâ€™s associates
// Add EventListener to Event Hub that listens for "showAssociates" event
// TEST - need event listener on DOM >> Where? Button Component
// Needs a place to go in the DOM - add Modal Container to index.html
// Get the Criminal ID from the detail
// Find the criminal from the array of criminals (>> import useCriminals)
// Call the ModalComponent function and pass in the criminal as an argument and store HTML string in a variable
// Add the resulting HTML to the DOM
// ADD MODAL CSS
// Import modal.css to main.css

// criminal object, in this case, criminal name, known associates, associates name, and alibi.
// String of HTML is being stored in HTMLRep. criminalObj.known_associates is grabbing the know associates 
// property from the array of criminals. .map is creating a new array with the associates name and alibi by 
// accessing the associate property and grabbing their name and alibi.
// .join("") is eliminating the commas that are between the objects properties.
